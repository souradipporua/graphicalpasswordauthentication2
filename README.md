This project focuses on Photo Authentication, a graphical-based security method that leverages images or biometric photos for user verification. By utilizing users' ability to recognize images, this approach enhances memorability and usability while improving security. The project involves designing a system where users authenticate via photo selection or face recognition, testing its resistance to attacks and ease of use. Ultimately, the goal is to compare this method with traditional passwords and evaluate its potential for widespread adoption.
